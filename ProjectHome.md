# What is SharePoint Twitter? #


Are you looking to show the twitter updates of your organization on your sharepoint portal ? If yes, then this project is what you might need.

We are providing five !webparts for SharePoint 2007 & SharePoint 2010.
  1. First, that can be used to show the tweets of any user on the SharePoint portal.
  1. Second webpart can be used to post tweet to twitter directly from your sharepoint portal.
  1. Third webpart can be used to show the friends of any user on the SharePoint portal.
  1. Fourth webpart can be used to show the followers of any user on the SharePoint portal.
